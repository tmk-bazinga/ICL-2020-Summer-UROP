# ICL-2020-Summer-UROP
In this repository is material that I produced for a UROP (Undergraduate Research Opportunity Placement) which I did from July to September 2020 at Imperial College London. My UROP supervisor was Dr Davoud Cheraghi, and the project is entitled 'A brief discussion of different geometries of Julia sets'.

Abstract of Report:
We begin by introducing some key basic concepts in complex dynamics which will help us define the Julia set. We then discuss the properties of the Julia set and explain how the Julia set, or rather the 'filled' Julia set, can be plotted. We will explore several different examples of functions whose Julia sets exhibit very different geometries.
For some of these ...
